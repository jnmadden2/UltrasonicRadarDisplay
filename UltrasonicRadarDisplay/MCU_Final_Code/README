Note This folder contains 3 different MCU code options
1. Single transmitter (just the middle transmitter fires)
2. Normal phased array (no modulo) applying the time delays without restricting to a cycle time period (25 microseconds)
3. Modulo phased array applying modulo to restrict time delays to be within a cycle, should be more efficent and still valid since phase delay is within to a cycle.

- Both phased array setups utilize FreeRTOS for multitasking
    -Transmitter task fires off each transmitter at the necessary times, and signals when a value can be received.
        -Time is based on when middle transmitter is fired (or effective middle between the middle two transmitters).
    
    -Receiver task wait until signal should clear (in this case waiting for after near feild distance)
        -Sends values to the Raspberry PI after a whole sweep to be used by the display

-Note in our implementation setting a pin to high causes a transmitter to stop firing, and setting low makes the transmitters fire since the pins are connected to the reset pin of the 555 timers.

-WIT1S and WIT1C registers are used to set and clear pins, as this is more efficent
    -Note these registers are for pins 32+
